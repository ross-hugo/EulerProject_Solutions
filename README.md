# EulerProject_Solutions
Here is the code that I have written to try and solve different Project Euler problems.

Project Euler problems come from https://projecteuler.net and they are mathematical problems designed to be solved with programming. Each problem gets prgressivly harder. Each solution is designed to have an optimal solution that should only take one minute to compute.
